In each case, two options: interaction net interpreter & direct compilation.

## LLVM

Target LLVM IR, with parallel (thread?) support.

## Michelson

Target Michelson. Will likely involve a lot of bespoke term compilation.

## WASM

Target WASM. Parallelism?

## EVM

Target EVM v1.x. Maybe pointless and should focus on eWASM instead.

## GPUs (CUDA / OpenCL)

Excellent way to demonstrate parallelism.

## FPGA

Parallelism + versatility, maybe there are large efficiency gains possible.
