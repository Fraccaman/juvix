Problems with dependently-typed languages

Too slow (execution)
> More overrides
> Heavier optimization work (in theory, very possible...)
> Supercompilation
> Assumed proofs of "built-in" data structures
> Safe rewrite proofs for execution model
> Search with proofs for optimizations

Proofs are time-intensive, hard to write
> Libraries of proofs for common functionality
> Graph search for asserted properties
> "Prototype first, proofs later"
