Juvix V2
========

*A more elegant language for a more civilized age*

### Why

* Smart contracts change language economics - high assurance very important, optimization very important, complex invariants very important, compile times / workflow less important
* Greater opportunity to fund protocol-level ~ language-level development, less need to be sponsored by particular company use case
* Most necessary work already exists with some precedent in the academic literature, no need for novel theory (yet)

### Architectural Overview

* Based on a fork of [Idris](https://idris-lang.org) - keeping rough Idris typesystem and IR
* Interactive mode with direct interaction with base platforms, code-as-data
* Transpilation to JS, native code, and distributed ledger VMs alike - seamless marshaling/unmarshaling
* Supercompilation?
* Think about gas / execution time metering, look at what Zen Protocol is doing
* Quotation / calling compiler inline - necessary?

### Supercompilation

#### Basics

#### Extensions

* Data-dependent / usage-dependent supercompilation over time? (a la "hotspot" in the JVM, some V8 features IIRC)
